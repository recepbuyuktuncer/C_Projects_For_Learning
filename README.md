# C Programming Practice Projects

This repository contains a collection of small C programs I developed to strengthen my understanding of basic programming concepts while learning C.

Each program focuses on a different fundamental topic, such as:

- ⭐ Loops and conditionals
- 📦 Arrays and string handling
- 📐 Geometry calculations (area, perimeter)
- 🎓 GPA calculator
- ✈️ Luggage fee calculator
- 🎨 Patterns with loops (e.g., butterfly wings)
- 🧮 Simple counters

These exercises helped me practice input/output operations, arithmetic processing, for-loops, and structured thinking.

> All programs are written and tested in a Linux environment using `gcc`.

## How to Compile

```bash
gcc filename.c -o outputname
./outputname
